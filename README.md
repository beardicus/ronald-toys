These are just some doodles for plotting in HPGL. Python for now, perhaps some
Processing in the future.

## face_trace.py

This uses Python [OpenCV](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/PythonInterface),
[Chiplotle](http://music.columbia.edu/cmc/chiplotle/), convert, autotrace, and pstoedit
to trace webcam input and output it as vector HPGL to a plotter.
